This program will allow a user to play Minesweeper. A lot of the logic and code was reused from https://repl.it/talk/learn/How-to-program-MineSweeper-in-Python-fully-explained-in-depth-tutorial/9397. Hint functionality was my own code.

Program usage:
python minesweeper.py

Libraries needed:
random, string, itertools, copy, sys
